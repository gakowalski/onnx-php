# onnx-php

## Introduction

I would like to create a PHP native library for running ONNX models.

At this point ONNX file is loaded into memory and deserialized from Protocol Buffer format into PHP object.
In `Onnx` folder you can find a lot of classes generated by `protoc` to get and set model data.

There is also a simple utility to show basic usage of current code:

```php
php info.php my_model.onnx
```

Sample input/output:

```
$ php info.php `locate modnet.onnx`

File: /var/opt/modnet/models/modnet.onnx
IrVersion: 6
ProducerName: pytorch
ProducerVersion: 1.7
Domain:
ModelVersion: 0
DocString:
```

## Installation

Git clone this repo and then:

```sh
composer install
```
